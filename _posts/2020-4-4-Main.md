title: Take back the Economy!
---

We are creating an infrastructure which tries to alter the essence of capitalism. Our micro-economy offers benefits to everybody and is democratically ruled, not owned by any elite. Our infrastructure is designed to withstand all known government attacks, lawyer-based attacks, and cooperate interest.

Our infrastructure is based on smartphones which can transmit money and information freely and are under democratic oversight.
